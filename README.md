# Quaver N Bits
Musician Finder App

- Web or Mobile App (choice is up to us)
Features:
- Sign up page where a new user comes onto the app. Sign up page with basic credentials and can see the home page after that. Authentication, stack is up to us.
- Home page is up to us: any sorts of images, dashboard.
- Any new user has to set up a profile when first signs in
     - What instrument they play
     - The expertise level at which he plays it
     - Samples of his past work (links to Youtube, embed video)
     - Location (zip code, city, state)
     - Basic contact information (phone number, social media)
     *** Are you looking for work? (Yes/No) If yes, his profile will appear on other people’s search queries. Otherwise, it’s private.
- Once signed in and profile created:
     - Create an ad using criteria:
          - What sort of musician is he looking for? (What instrument, level, location)
     - App will filter out profiles and populate a list based on criteria.
     - Profiles that are matched have said “Yes” to looking for work (no private profiles)
     - Should be able to send a request (either text box and submit, or a notification to user)
     - That user can accept or reject. If he accepts, the profile is shared with the user who created the ad.
     - Only way another profile can be viewed is if users have been matched.
- Co-features:
     - View all created ads (would happen naturally)
     - Edit/Delete created ad (let user change their mind about the ad they created)
     - View your profile
     - Edit your profile
     - Can’t delete profile.
- Creating a profile is for you to allow yourself to get matched with other users.
- No search functionality, no ability to look at other profiles.
- Come up with 15 user stores - split each one of those into five per sprint.
     - Example: Setting up database can be a user story.
